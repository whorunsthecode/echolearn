# Security Implementation - EchoLearn

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented to protect the EchoLearn application from common vulnerabilities.

## Security Vulnerabilities Addressed

### 1. Rate Limiting on Login Attempts ✅

**Problem:** No rate limiting on login attempts allowed brute force attacks.

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Express Rate Limiting:** Maximum 5 login attempts per 15-minute window per IP
- **Brute Force Protection:** Progressive delays after failed attempts (5 min → 1 hour)
- **Account Lockout:** Accounts lock for 2 hours after 5 failed attempts
- **IP-based Tracking:** Prevents attackers from bypassing with multiple accounts

**Implementation Details:**
- `express-rate-limit` middleware with progressive delays
- Enhanced login rate limiting (3 attempts per 15 minutes)
- User model includes `loginAttempts` and `lockUntil` fields
- Automatic lockout reset after successful login

### 2. Secured API Keys ✅

**Problem:** API keys exposed in frontend environment variables (VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY).

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Backend Proxy:** All API calls routed through secure backend endpoints
- **Environment Isolation:** API keys stored only in backend environment variables
- **No Client Exposure:** Frontend never sees actual API keys
- **Secure Request Validation:** All AI requests authenticated and validated

**Implementation Details:**
- Moved Gemini API calls to `/api/ai/*` endpoints
- JWT authentication required for all AI services
- Input validation and sanitization on all requests
- Fallback to demo data if API fails

### 3. Admin Functions Protected by Backend Routes ✅

**Problem:** Admin functions protected only by frontend routes, allowing bypass.

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Server-side role validation
- **JWT Authentication:** All admin endpoints require valid tokens
- **Middleware Protection:** `requireRole('admin')` middleware on all admin routes
- **Database-Level Validation:** User roles stored and validated in database

**Implementation Details:**
- Admin routes in `/api/admin/*` with proper middleware
- User model includes `role` field (user, admin, teacher)
- Prevention of self-role changes and self-deletion
- Comprehensive logging of all admin actions

### 4. Database Manipulation Prevention ✅

**Problem:** Direct database manipulation possible from frontend.

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Backend-Only Database Access:** No direct database connections from frontend
- **Input Sanitization:** All user inputs sanitized against injection attacks
- **Parameterized Queries:** MongoDB queries use safe parameterization
- **Validation Middleware:** express-validator on all endpoints

**Implementation Details:**
- `express-mongo-sanitize` prevents NoSQL injection
- `express-validator` validates all input data
- User model with proper schema validation
- XSS protection with input sanitization

## Additional Security Measures Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Tokens:** Secure, stateless authentication
- **Token Expiration:** 7-day expiration with refresh capability
- **Active Token Management:** Track and revoke tokens per user
- **Password Requirements:** Strong password validation (8+ chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- **Password Hashing:** bcrypt with salt rounds of 12

### Data Protection
- **Input Sanitization:** XSS protection on all user inputs
- **Output Encoding:** Safe rendering of user-generated content
- **CORS Configuration:** Restricted to allowed origins
- **Request Size Limits:** Prevent DoS attacks with large payloads

### Security Headers
- **Helmet.js:** Comprehensive security headers
- **Content Security Policy:** Prevents XSS attacks
- **HSTS:** Enforces HTTPS in production
- **X-Frame-Options:** Prevents clickjacking
- **X-Content-Type-Options:** Prevents MIME sniffing

### Logging & Monitoring
- **Winston Logger:** Comprehensive logging system
- **Security Event Tracking:** Failed login attempts, admin actions
- **Error Logging:** Detailed error logging for debugging
- **User Activity Tracking:** Login/logout events with IP addresses

### API Security
- **Rate Limiting by User:** AI endpoints limited per authenticated user
- **Request Validation:** All API requests validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling:** Secure error responses without data leakage
- **Timeout Protection:** Prevent long-running requests

## Architecture Security Benefits

### Backend-First Design
- **Single Source of Truth:** All business logic in backend
- **Centralized Security:** Security policies enforced server-side
- **API Gateway Pattern:** Frontend acts as presentation layer only

### Database Security
- **MongoDB Security:** Proper indexing and query optimization
- **Connection Security:** Secure connection strings and authentication
- **Data Validation:** Schema-level validation and sanitization

### Production Considerations
- **Environment Variables:** Secure configuration management
- **HTTPS Enforcement:** SSL/TLS for all communications
- **Secret Management:** Proper handling of sensitive data
- **Regular Updates:** Dependency management and security patches

## Usage Instructions

### For Developers

1. **Environment Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Copy environment template
   cp server/config/environment.template.js .env.example
   
   # Create your .env file
   # Add all required variables with secure values
   ```

2. **Database Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Install MongoDB
   # Create database: echolearn
   # User will be created automatically on first registration
   ```

3. **Running Securely:**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Start in development (both frontend and backend)
   npm run dev
   
   # Start backend only
   npm run dev:backend
   
   # Start frontend only
   npm run dev:frontend
   ```

### For Production Deployment

1. **Environment Variables:**
   - Set strong JWT_SECRET (minimum 256 bits)
   - Configure proper MONGODB_URI
   - Set FRONTEND_URL to your domain
   - Add valid API keys for external services

2. **Security Checklist:**
   - [ ] HTTPS enabled
   - [ ] Environment variables secured
   - [ ] Database connection secured
   - [ ] Regular security updates scheduled
   - [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
   - [ ] Backup and recovery procedures in place

## Security Testing

### Recommended Tests
- **Authentication Testing:** Verify JWT handling and token validation
